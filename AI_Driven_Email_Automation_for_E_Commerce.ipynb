        "# AI-Driven Email Automation for E-Commerce\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Description:\n",
        "This is an AI-driven application designed to automate the processing of email order requests and customer inquiries for a fashion store. The goal was to create a scalable and intelligent system capable of handling a large volume of emails, efficiently categorizing them, and generating accurate and personalized responses based on the store's product catalog and inventory status.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objective:\n",
        "The primary objective of this project was to build a proof-of-concept application that could intelligently process incoming emails by categorizing them into product inquiries or order requests and responding appropriately. The system was designed to seamlessly integrate with the store's existing product catalog, ensuring that responses to customers were both relevant and accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Inputs:\n",
        "\n",
        "The project utilized a Google Spreadsheet **[Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uWkz7nlLoMLOzgnTxvPe7sA3FISArbOaa5NacDlKZSU)** containing the following data:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Products**: List of products with fields including product ID, name, category, stock amount, detailed description, and season.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Emails**: Sequential list of emails with fields such as email ID, subject, and body content.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Implementation Strategy:\n",
        "\n",
        "The project was structured into three main tasks, each addressing a specific aspect of the email processing workflow:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Classify emails\n",
        "    \n",
        "The first task involved classifying each email as either a _**\"product inquiry\"**_ or an _**\"order request\"**_. This classification was crucial for routing the emails to the appropriate processing pipeline. The classification system leveraged advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques using large language models (LLMs) to accurately determine the intent behind each email.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output:** The results were populated in the **email-classification** sheet with columns: email ID and category.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Process order requests\n",
        "\n",
        "The second task focused on processing the order requests. For each request, the system verified product availability in the inventory. If the requested products were available in sufficient quantities, an order was created with a **\"created\"** status. If any items were out of stock, the order was marked as **\"out of stock\"** with the appropriate quantity. The system also updated the stock levels in the catalog to reflect the current inventory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the system generated customer response emails based on the order status, informing customers whether their order was fully or partially fulfilled, or if it could not be processed due to insufficient stock. These responses were designed to be production-ready, offering options such as waiting for restock or selecting alternative products.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output:** The results were populated in the **\"order-status\"** sheet with columns: email ID, product ID, quantity, and status. Response emails were populated in the **\"order-response\"** sheet with columns: email ID and response.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Handle product inquiry\n",
        "\n",
        "The final task involved responding to general product inquiries. The system extracted relevant product information from the emails and matched it with the store's product catalog. It then generated user-friendly responses containing product details such as descriptions, stock availability, and prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "The solution was designed to be highly scalable, capable of handling a product catalog containing over 100,000 items without overwhelming the system or exceeding token limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Output**: The results were populated in the \"inquiry-response\" sheet with columns: email ID and response.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tools and Technologies:\n",
        "- **OpenAI GPT-4:** Utilized for natural language processing and generating responses.\n",
        "- **Python:** Core programming language used for developing the application.\n",
        "- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and handling the Google Spreadsheet data.\n",
        "- **Rapidfuzz:** Employed for fuzzy matching product names to ensure accurate product identification.\n",
        "- **Jupyter Notebook:** Environment for coding, testing, and documenting the project.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion:\n",
        "\n",
        "This project demonstrated the potential of AI to automate and enhance customer service operations in an e-commerce setting. By leveraging advanced LLMs, the system was able to efficiently process and respond to a variety of customer emails, ensuring accurate order handling and personalized product recommendations. The scalable design makes it suitable for businesses with extensive product catalogs and high email traffic, providing a robust solution for improving customer engagement and operational efficiency.\n"
